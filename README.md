### FinTrack

#### Environment setup

In order to run the project locally, ensure Yarn is available. If it is not, head to [their doc](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) to learn how to install it.

Another requirement is to use Node 22. Download it from [their website](https://nodejs.org/en/download) or using `nvm` for a better node version management.

With both installed,

1. install the project dependencies

```
yarn
```

2. spin up the docker containers

```
yarn docker:up
```
